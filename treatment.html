                      like increased heart rate and muscle tension. Excessive or

                      <p id="ovtxt">
                        When anxiety becomes overwhelming, one of the most
                        straightforward responses is avoidance—stepping away
                        from the source of anxiety or trying to numb the
                        uncomfortable feelings. While avoidance may offer
                        temporary relief, it's important to note that this
                        respite is short-lived, and anxiety often returns even
                        stronger than before. The anxiety cycle involves
                        avoiding fears, making those fears stronger over time.
                        Avoidance becomes harder, and anxiety worsens. Effective
                        anxiety treatments break this cycle by encouraging
                        facing fears. Through hypnotherapy, we can identify your
                        specific triggers and safely confront them together.

                        Anxiety and stress manifest in various forms and affect
                        individuals differently. Here are some common types of
                        anxiety and stress:

                          <strong>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD):</strong>
                          People with GAD experience excessive worry and anxiety
                          about everyday situations, often with no specific
                          cause. This persistent anxiety can interfere with
                          daily life.

                          <strong>Social Anxiety Disorder:</strong> Individuals
                          with social anxiety fear social situations and
                          interactions. They may worry excessively about being
                          judged or embarrassed in public, leading to avoidance
                          of social events.

                        <li>

                          by sudden and intense panic attacks, which can include
                          symptoms like a racing heart, shortness of breath, and
                          a sense of impending doom. Panic attacks can be
                          debilitating and may lead to avoidance behavior.

                          intense fear of particular objects or situations, such
                          as heights, spiders, or flying. People with phobias go
                          to great lengths to avoid their triggers.

                          OCD involves obsessions (intrusive, distressing
                          thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors or
                          mental acts). These rituals are performed to alleviate
                          anxiety, even though individuals realize they are
                          irrational.

                          frequent doctor visits or avoidance of medical

                      Experiencing anger often leads to subsequent regret, as it
                      can impair rational thinking and result in actions we
                      later wish to avoid. However, anger itself isn't always
                      negative; when managed properly, it can motivate us to
                      address adverse situations, assert our rights, and protect
                      ourselves from harm.

                        Anger management teaches individuals to deal with their
                        anger in a healthy way. As the name implies, it's about
                        managing anger, not extinguishing it entirely. It begins
                        with self-awareness, helping individuals recognize their
                        anger before it takes over their minds.

                        Once they've learned to catch their anger early, they
                        then acquire techniques to control it. If you catch your
                        anger before it explodes, you will be able to control
                        it. If you wait too long, there's little you can do to
                        stop it. Because of this, learning to catch your anger
                        early will be the most important skill you learn in
                        anger management.

                        work. The truth is, your anger doesn't come from
                        nowhere. It grows. Try this exercise to see what I mean:
                        Wherever you are, stop and listen to the sounds around
                        you. Can you hear anything that you didn't notice
                        before? Maybe a refrigerator, air conditioning, or birds
                        chirping? Your brain is constantly filtering out sounds
                        that are in the background so you can focus on the task
                        at hand. Similarly, when feelings of stress and anger
                        are common, your brain may filter them out of your
                        awareness—until you explode.

                        The good news is, you can learn to become more aware of
                        your anger with a bit of practice. I will help you
                        identify your anger warning signs, so you can catch your
                        anger early and allow yourself time to think before you
                        act. You will be able to take control of your actions,
                        manage your thoughts, and control your emotions much
                        better.

                      you. There are many causes of addiction and together we

                        Depression goes beyond occasional feelings of sadness;
                        it involves persistent and prolonged periods of deep
                        sadness that can last for weeks or even months. Despite
                        some misconceptions, depression is a genuine health
                        condition that affects approximately one in 10 people
                        during their lifetime. It doesn't discriminate by age or
                        gender, impacting individuals of all ages, including
                        children. In fact, studies reveal that around 4% of
                        children in the UK aged five to 16 experience symptoms
                        of depression or anxiety.

                        Depression symptoms can vary among individuals, but
                        typically include feelings of hopelessness, sadness, and
                        a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities.
                        These symptoms can be severe enough to disrupt work,
                        social interactions, and family life, lasting for weeks
                        or even months.

                        activity. People with phobias typically experience
                        overwhelming anxiety and distress when confronted with
                        their phobia's trigger, even if the threat is not
                        objectively dangerous. Phobias can significantly
                        interfere with daily life and functioning. Common
                        examples of phobias include fear of heights
                        (acrophobia), fear of spiders (arachnophobia), fear of
                        flying (aviophobia), and fear of public speaking

                        Self-harm refers to deliberate, intentional actions
                        taken by an individual to cause physical harm or injury
                        to themselves as a way of coping with emotional pain,
                        stress, or distressing feelings. Common methods of
                        self-harm include cutting, burning, biting, hitting,
                        scratching, or any other act that results in
                        self-inflicted physical harm. Self-harm is often a sign
                        of underlying emotional or psychological struggles and
                        is not a healthy or constructive way of dealing with
                        emotional pain.

                        Low confidence refers to a lack of self-assurance or
                        belief in one's abilities and worth. Individuals with
                        low confidence often doubt themselves, their skills, and
                        their capacity to succeed. This can manifest in various
                        areas of life, including work, relationships, and
                        personal goals. Low confidence can be influenced by past
                        experiences, negative self-perception, or external
                        factors, but it is a quality that can be improved
                        through self-awareness, positive self-talk, setting and
                        achieving small goals, and seeking support from friends,
                        family, or a therapist.
