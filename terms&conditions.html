                        My website is full of explanations as to how I will work to ensure that you receive the best possible hypnotherapy, the best possible outcomes. It should be borne in mind, however, that in agreeing to work with me you also incur some responsibilities of your own. These responsibilities are based on the principle that I am a human being, worthy of respect, and that I am working to support my family through helping others to live better, happier and more fulfilling lives. By agreeing to work with me you therefore indicate acceptance of these terms and conditions. Please have a read of these terms and conditions. If they feel too onerous and unreasonable (I believe them to be in accordance with standard practice) then please feel free to find a therapist who works in a different way. Otherwise, feel free to get in contact should you agree that they are reasonable.

                        Untitled design (82)Very few people simply fail to turn up. Those few who do, however, leave me out of pocket because I still have to pay room rent and because I will have had to travel to the location concerned. I’m also left with a period of dead time in which little of any importance can be achieved. I need 48 hours' notice of cancellation. Sessions canceled at less notice will incur a cost of half of the normal fee in the first instance and a full fee for further instances. Of course, in cases of sudden illness, acts of God or other emergencies I am free to exercise discretion with regard to fees for late notice cancellations. This, however, will be at my own discretion.

                        I work in a caring profession but you’ll understand that I do need paying clients who actually arrive for their sessions, for this is my living. You’ll also understand that as a father, a husband, a therapist, a person studying a language as well as an MA in child and adolescent psychotherapy, my time is precious. I have none to waste. We can’t avoid the occasional traffic jam, blocked road or faulty alarm clock.  However, if you’re late to our session then I reserve the right to stick to our allotted time. You are paying for an hour of therapy and that hour begins when our agreed time begins. It doesn’t begin upon your arrival. Please do your best to be on time for every session. An hour isn’t a very long period of time and the quality and quantity of that which we’re able to achieve will often be impaired by lateness. If you’re running late then it would be wonderful if you could safely let me know of your impending late arrival. As stated above, my time is precious and if I am still waiting for you, ten minutes into the session, (with no explanation or warning given) then I reserve the right to claim back what is left of the hour and to wander off to do something more constructive instead.

                        I will outline payment options when I email you directions, forms and the like. Please do come with full payment for every session. If people repeatedly forget to bring payment, in full, then I reserve the right refuse future sessions until the outstanding amount is settled. Future sessions may then, at my discretion, have to be paid for in advance. If I agree to payment via bank transfer then please be sure to transfer the money within 48 hours of our session having taken place. I reserve the right to refuse further sessions to those who haven’t done this. I’m not a ‘big business’ and can’t afford to wait an age for people to get around to such things. The failure to pay outstanding fees within a reasonable period of time will result in action being taken through the small claims court.

                        If you arrive for a session under the influence of drugs or alcohol, to the extent that I judge proceeding with therapy to be inadvisable,  then I reserve the right to refuse you admittance to the location concerned and to refuse to conduct the session. This will be at my discretion. The session will be charged for nevertheless. If I judge you to be incapable of making your way home safely then I will take whatever steps are necessary in order to keep you and the public safe.

                        hypnotherapy online by zoomIf we judge it desirable and therapeutic for there to be contact between sessions then that’s all well and good. I’m more than happy to have the occasional ‘phone conversation, or an exchange of emails, if that proves helpful to the therapy. If I am working with your child then regular contact will be arranged after every four sessions.
                        However, such contact will always be at my discretion. At the time of writing I have 70 clients and would be unable to cope with excessive quantities of correspondence between sessions, should they all choose to get in touch.
                        If we cannot establish a reasonable agreement regarding such things and should I therefore find myself subjected to unreasonable demands regarding contact then I will remind you that contact is at my discretion and will act to re-state expectations.
                        If unreasonable demands continue then I reserve the right to terminate therapy. This very rarely happens but it is best to make such things clear beforehand. They say that ‘good fences make good neighbours’. Good therapeutic boundaries also make for a good therapeutic relationship.

                        With regard to abuse, it is sometimes the case (rarely) that I become the focus of the client’s anger and distress. That’s fine.

If, however, you direct verbal abuse at me which I consider to be outside of the general therapeutic remit, I reserve the right to terminate the therapeutic relationship. Resolved! Hypnotherapy’s GDPR (use of data) policy
                        Statement of Intent. This policy explains how Resolved! Hypnotherapy uses and protects the information you provide when becoming a client and using this site.
                        The information you give me will be kept secure, treated with respect and will only be used for the purposes for which it has been provided.
                        This policy will be updated periodically in line with current legislation. When you contact me via my website, phone or email I will collect your:
                        Name - Email Address - Telephone Number
                        Any information necessary for you to explain the nature of your problems, goals and circumstances.
                        How is this information used?
                        I use this information to get in touch with you in order  to discuss your needs and goals.
                        I may also use this information so that I may improve my services.
                        If you choose to come to see me I will send you a copy of this Privacy Policy so that you’ll be aware of how I use data gathered before and during our sessions.
                        I will ask you for your GP’s contact details and some basic health information: Some rare conditions prevent the ethical use of hypnosis and I sometimes need to consult with medical professionals as to whether they’re happy for me to work with their patients. I will ask you regarding these things during our first session, or during our telephone conversation prior to that session.

                        I will ask you for details of your next of kin: this is used very rarely and only in emergency situations. In fact, I have never had to contact the next of kin to this point in time.
                        
                        You do not have to consent to the collection of information, however, if you choose
                        not to provide it, I may not be able to work with you.
                        In the course of our sessions:
                        I will ask for your email address for the purposes of sending you any recordings we make as a part of the therapeutic process. It may also be necessary to send emails to confirm or rearrange appointments.
                        
                        I will make a note of information you provide me in order that we can plan bespoke therapy sessions and recordings. 
                        
                        I will not ask for and do not receive or retain your bank details.
                        
                        Under the General Data Protection Regulations which are effective from May 2018
                        you have the following rights:
                        The right to be informed (which is why I have produced this policy)
                        
                        the right of access: if you wish to see your file then please make a request in writing to me, Paul Hughes, the Data Processor. I will provide you with the information within 30 days of your request.
                        
                        The right to rectification: this means you can request changes to any information I hold that is factually inaccurate. If you believe any of the information I hold on you is incorrect then please let me know as soon as possible and I will make the relevant changes, as soon as is possible.
                        
                        The right to erasure: given the nature of our work it is considered good practice to hold your details for a period of  time. After this your information will be securely destroyed. My insurers have no fixed policy on this matter and so I opt to keep this information for two years.
                        
                        The right to restrict processing: I will only use the information for the purposes that I have stated above. I uphold the common law principles of confidentiality where the duty to keep confidence is measured against the concept of
                        ‘greater good’. If in my opinion, as a therapist, there is good reason to believe not to disclose would cause danger or serious harm to self, the therapist or others then your GP or other appropriate agencies may be contacted. Only information required to ensure safety of relevant parties would be disclosed. Information may have to be disclosed without consent for the prevention, detection or prosecution of a crime. The sharing of anonymous case histories with my supervisor is not a breach of professional confidentiality.
                        
                        The right to data portability: this right is more relevant to IT companies e.g. the sharing of information when moving from one utility provider to another. I will not share your information without your specific consent, other than in the
                        situations described above.
                        
                        The right to object: I will not contact you for marketing purposes unless you have given me specific consent to do so.
                        
                        The right not to be subject to automated decision-making including profiling: I will not use your information for profiling purposes.
